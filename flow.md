Step 1: Understand the Project Overview

Start with README.md: This file provides the project overview, setup instructions, and likely a summary of what the project does (a personal website with features like a news feed, puzzle game, and weather widget). Read it to understand the project’s purpose, tech stack (Flask, Python, Jinja2), and how to set it up locally.
Check LICENSE to understand usage and contribution terms.
Review .gitignore to know which files (e.g., venv, .env, __pycache__) are excluded from version control.
Look at docs/ for detailed documentation:

ARCHITECTURE.md: Understand the system design and how components interact.
CONTENT_GUIDE.md: Learn how to add or update content (e.g., news, bulletins).
RENDER_DEPLOY.md: If you plan to deploy, this explains the setup on Render.



Step 2: Set Up the Environment

Install dependencies: Open requirements.txt to see the Python libraries needed (e.g., Flask, Jinja2). Install them locally using:
textpip install -r requirements.txt
(Note: I’m not writing code, just referencing the process as you requested no code.)
Configure environment variables: Copy .env.example to .env and fill in required values (e.g., API keys for weather or RSS feeds). This file is a template for environment variables used in app/config.py.
Understand wsgi.py: This is the entry point for running the Flask app with a WSGI server like Gunicorn, used for deployment on Render.
Check render.yaml: This defines the deployment configuration for Render, including web services and cron jobs (e.g., for updating news.json or weather_snapshot.json).

Step 3: Explore the Core Application (app/)
The app/ directory contains the Flask application’s core logic. Here’s where to focus:

__init__.py: This is the app factory, setting up the Flask app and registering blueprints (routes). Start here to understand how the app initializes.
config.py: Centralized configuration, pulling from environment variables or defaults. Check this to ensure your .env settings align.
routes/: Defines URL endpoints via Flask blueprints:

pages.py: Handles static pages like home, about, projects, skills, resume, and contact.
webbabyguard.py: Manages the news feed page (likely pulls from data/news.json and data/bulletins.yaml).
puzzle.py: Controls the sliding puzzle game, using assets in data/playme/.
api.py: Provides JSON APIs for news, weather, RSS, theme toggling, and health checks.
assets.py: Serves static files like robots.txt, sitemap.xml, and favicons.


services/: Contains backend logic, which is testable and independent of Flask:

rss_ingest.py and rss_build.py: Handle fetching and generating RSS feeds (data/news.json, rss.xml).
weather.py: Fetches and formats weather data (data/weather_snapshot.json).
content.py: Sanitizes and renders data/bulletins.yaml for the Webbabyguard page.
schema.py: Defines JSON schemas for validating news, weather, and bulletins.
cache.py and metrics.py: Handle caching (ETags, Last-Modified) and health metrics.


templates/: Jinja2 templates for rendering HTML:

base.html: The global template with shared layout (head, assets).
layout/: Page layouts (main.html for standard pages, article.html for long-form content).
components/: Reusable UI elements like navigation, footer, and news cards.
pages/: Specific page templates (e.g., home.html, webbabyguard.html, puzzle.html).
seo/: Templates for sitemap.xml, robots.txt, and rss.xml.


static/: Static assets:

css/: Stylesheets (e.g., base.css for resets, puzzle.css for the game).
js/: JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., puzzle.js for game logic, theme.js for dark/light mode).
img/: Images, including puzzle assets (data/playme/), logos, favicons, and mascot animations for loading, success, error, and maintenance states.



Step 4: Understand Data and Content

data/: Stores runtime and content files:

news.json: Generated by scripts/build_feeds.py for the Webbabyguard news feed.
weather_snapshot.json: Cached weather data, updated via cron.
bulletins.yaml: Content for Webbabyguard news, validated by scripts/validate_content.py.
playme/: Puzzle game images (e.g., playme1.jpg, playme12.webp). Note the duplicate playme12.jpg and playme12.webp—check if this is intentional or needs cleanup.


aboutme.txt: Plain text for the About Me page, likely rendered in templates/pages/about.html.

Step 5: Review Scripts
The scripts/ directory contains automation tools:

build_feeds.py: Fetches RSS and weather data, updating news.json and rss.xml. Run this to refresh content.
optimize_images.py: Compresses or converts images (e.g., puzzle images, mascots). Use this if adding new images.
validate_content.py: Lints and validates bulletins.yaml and schemas. Run this to ensure content integrity.

Step 6: Testing and CI

tests/: Contains unit tests for critical components (e.g., test_rss_ingest.py, test_weather.py). Review these to understand expected behavior.
.github/workflows/ci.yml: Defines the CI pipeline for linting and testing. Check this to ensure your changes pass automated checks.

Step 7: Plan Your Next Steps
Based on your goal, here are suggested starting points:

If developing a new feature: Start in app/routes/ to add a new blueprint or modify existing ones (e.g., pages.py for a new page). Update templates/pages/ and static/ as needed.
If updating content: Edit data/bulletins.yaml for Webbabyguard news or aboutme.txt for the About page. Run scripts/validate_content.py to check changes.
If working on the puzzle game: Focus on data/playme/ for assets, app/routes/puzzle.py for logic, templates/pages/puzzle.html for the UI, and static/js/puzzle.js for interactivity.
If deploying: Review render.yaml and RENDER_DEPLOY.md for Render setup. Ensure wsgi.py and .env are configured correctly.
If troubleshooting: Check app/services/ for backend logic issues, tests/ for failing tests, or docs/SECURITY.md for security-related concerns.

Step 8: Run the App Locally
To test the app, you’ll need to run the Flask server locally (refer to README.md for exact commands, typically involving wsgi.py). Ensure all dependencies are installed and .env is set up. Visit the endpoints defined in app/routes/ (e.g., / for home, /webbabyguard for news, /puzzle for the game).
