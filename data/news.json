The plan was to fix bugs, add new keyboard shortcuts, build a command palette, and eventually merge these features into Django's core admin. I initially thought getting my GSoC proposal accepted meant I could dive straight into coding. But Tom explained that Django has its own process for new features, which starts off with community discussions.</p>\n<p>After posting on the forum and gath",
